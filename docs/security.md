# Security Notes (ask-data-app)

## Main risks
1) Executing unsafe code generated by an LLM
2) Data leakage (saving files, logging sensitive content)
3) API quota abuse (public demo links)

## Controls used
- Avoid arbitrary Python execution (no unsafe `exec`)
- If SQL is used: allow only SELECT / WITH queries
- API keys are stored as Secrets/Env vars (never in GitHub)
- Cache to reduce repeated calls
- Optional: demo password + rate limiting

## Data handling
- Excel is processed in memory
- In demo mode: do not store uploaded files
- In work mode: apply retention policy + encryption + audit logging
